      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Fatima Coulibaly. I'm in my final semester at The New School, where I study Journalism + Design. <strong>#TNSGRAD22</strong> &#127891;</p>


      <p>After college, I'm hoping to work as a freelance writer for publications such as <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us" target="_blank">Refinery29</a> and <a href="https://www.byrdie.com/" target="_blank">Byrdie</a>. I also would like to improve my skills in design, including web and UX design. In addition, I love learning about topics relating to beauty, tech, culture, and business.</p>

      <p>Currently, I'm redeveloping an old project from my previous class, Transmedia Skills & Craft. It's about <a href = "https://fatimacoulibaly.github.io/SustainableBeauty/" target="_blank">sustainability</a> within the beauty sector.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I write for The New School's chapter of Her Campus. You can check out my latest collaboration piece with other student writers on <a href="https://www.hercampus.com/school/new-school/spending-spring-break-in-nyc/" target="_blank">places to visit in NYC for Spring Break.</a></p>
